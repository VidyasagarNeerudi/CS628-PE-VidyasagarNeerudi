# Todo-List

# Input
The Todo List app provides a text input field where users can enter new tasks. This input field appears as part of the TodoForm component. Users can enter task descriptions directly into this box. The input is recorded in real time via the onChange event handler, which updates the component's state (taskInput) with each keystroke. This gives the user rapid feedback while they type. After entering their task, the user may submit it by either using the Enter key or selecting the "Add Task" button. This interaction calls the handleFormSubmit function, which processes the input and, if not empty, adds the new task to the list.

# Process
The Todo List app takes user input through several important steps and uses React's useState hook for state management. The main App component manages the todos state, which is an array of task objects. When a user submits a new task, the addTodo function is invoked, updating the todos state by creating a new task object with a unique ID and the user's input content.
When a user selects the "Delete" button to eliminate a task, the deleteTodo function filters the todos array depending on the selected task's ID. This modified array becomes the new state, prompting React to re-render the component and remove the job from the visible list. Throughout the process, React's virtual DOM updates just the necessary sections of the UI, resulting in seamless and responsive user interactions.


# Output
The Todo List app creates a dynamically rendered list of tasks, which is shown beneath the input form. Each task in the list is represented as a separate item, with the task description input by the user. A "Delete" button appears next to each task, allowing users to delete tasks that have been finished or are no longer required. The list changes in real time: new tasks display as soon as they are added, and deleted items are immediately removed from view. This rapid visual feedback guarantees that consumers are always aware of the current status of their to-do list. Users can interact with this output by reading through their assignments and clicking the "Delete" button to eliminate individual items, making task management straightforward and intuitive.
