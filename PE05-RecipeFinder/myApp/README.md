# INPUT
Through two main approaches—reciene searching and recipe creation—the program promotes user participation. Entering keywords into a designated search window lets users search for terms connected to ingredients or particular recipe names. Users must fill a form covering several components—including the dish's title, a list of ingredients, thorough preparation directions, and possible images—to add a new recipe. The frontend React application subsequently organizes and gets ready the data for the backend server, therefore forwarding this information. The input then comes to the server via an HTTP request for additional handling.

# PROCESS
When the input is received by the backend (Node.js with Express), the server handles it according to the kind of request. For new recipes, the backend validates the data for accuracy, ensuring that all needed fields exist. The server then talks with the MongoDB Atlas database, either querying for existing recipes that match the search keywords or saving new recipe details if a dish is requested to be added. Before a response is returned, the data is validated, transformed, and stored on the server. In the case of a search, the backend queries the database and returns pertinent results.

# OUTPUT
The output comes from the server's processing and is returned to the frontend for user display.  Regarding a search, the result is a list of recipes that fit the search parameters comprising recipe names, ingredients, and cooking techniques.  The output of adding, editing, or removing a recipe consists in a confirmation message denoting either success or failure of the action.  Furthermore returned to the frontend to display the most current data is the revised recipe list.  The output guarantees a flawless and interactive experience by means of feedback depending on user involvement with the application.
